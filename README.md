# MultiFocal_Preparation
An ImageJ plugin to convert raw camera recordings from a four-plane multifocal imaging setup, where the planes are projected to different positions of the camera chip, into a hyperstack (including image alignment and corrections of background and intensity). This plugin belongs to the software published along https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.16.099390. Download the latest release of MultiFocal_Preparation [here](https://github.com/hansenjn/MultiFocal_Preparation/releases/).

A manual for the multifocal analysis pipeline will be uploaded here soon.
